# Userscripts
These are small userscripts I've written, to provide miscellaneous tweaks to websites. To be installed using an extension such as [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

### Awful People
Simply attach a small 'tag' to any user that will appear underneath their name with each post. Saved to your browser's localStorage so not very portable.

### Giant Bomb: Hide 'In This Episode' list
Simple script to automatically hide the list of games played "In This Episode:" on every show page on Giant Bomb. Some people prefer to be surprised by the games that come up during UPF or Old Games Shows, etc. 

### Perseus Hover Footnotes
This script allows you to simply hover over footnote numbers on the Perseus Project website and see the referenced note right by your cursor, instead of having to click to scroll down to it and then find your way back afterwards.

It also removes the boilerplate copyright info on the bottom of every page, and hides the intrusive section markers that are otherwise unavoidably peppered throughout the text you're trying to read.
